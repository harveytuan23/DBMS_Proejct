# External Storage Data Management System Development

## Description
This project demonstrates my understanding of DBMS, showcasing how to efficiently allocate storage space using data structures.

•	Developed efficient data structures to manage variable-length records in external storage, focusing on optimizing access and search operations within the constraints of main memory. 

•	Engineered and refined search algorithms to handle large datasets with minimal memory usage, significantly improving the system's performance and data retrieval speed. 

•	Utilized C++ programming techniques to ensure the system's robustness, reliability, and scalability, addressing complex challenges in data management and storage optimization.

## Set up

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/harveytuan23/CS550_Computer_Graphic_Final_Project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd yourprojectname`
3. Run program: `g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o main.out`, then `main.out`
