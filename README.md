## Description
This OpenGL project showcases the fascinating aspects of computer graphics by rendering dynamic 3D geometries. Key features of this project include:

- **Dynamic Color Changes:** The spheres change their color as they collide.
- **Lighting and Shadows:** Above the Newton's Cradles, there is a light source that continuously revolves, causing the shadows on the ground to constantly shift.
- **Pirate Ship Viewpoint:** Switched to a viewpoint resembling a pirate ship at an amusement park, giving the impression that you are sitting on one of the spheres, following its motion.
- **Simulate Gravity:** Manipulated gravity-related variables within the animation enhances the realism of the ball's motion. At the highest point, the initial velocity is zero, while at the lowest point, the velocity is at its maximum speed.

## Set up (For Mac User)
To run this project, you need to have OpenGL installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up: 

1. Install OpenGL
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/harveytuan23/CS550_Computer_Graphic_Final_Project.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd yourprojectname`
4. Run program: `make shadow`, then `./shadow`
